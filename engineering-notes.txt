    Redux is more manageable if you group by feature as opposed to 
    functionality, similar to the Ducks approach. In the “grouping by
    functionality” approach where all actions, reducers, etc live in 
    a separate folder, it can be increasingly difficult to navigate between 
    files when the number grows in production. When you group by feature,
    you always have the files you need in a single, compact location.
